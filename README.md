# Egg 'N' Yolk (eggnyolk-js)

Easter is always coming, and in 2018 it's April Fool's Day!

Code and Comments are vague for a reason, but there should be enough to get you going! Have fun!

I'll say little more about what this code does (it is not nefarious) but if you want an egg for your site you'll have to hunt around the code to see exactly what you'll get.

This should be as much fun for the site owner to descramble and customize as it is for those who visit a site and come across it.

Though there is a default action that links to one of my own creations feel free to make it fun and link to your own diversion. Just use the yolk() function to scramble up your own URL to redirect to.

## Installation

Add the contents of egg.js to your script file or point to it as the source of a script tag.

There is a variable, which you will have to hunt for (it is an Easter Egg, after all!), that sets the destination page once the keyboard sequence is successfully entered. You can set the destination to be whatever you want by using the yolk() function in your console.

Though the script invokes a redirect, you can change it to do what ever you want once the proper command sequence is entered.

Have fun hunting through the code and providing an Easter Egg for your users!

## Demo

Visit the [eggnyolk-js demo page](https://eggnyolk-js.demo.63klabs.net) and try a sequence of keystrokes to see if you can find the Easter Egg!
