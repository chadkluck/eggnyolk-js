Egg N Yolk

Code and Comments are vague for a reason, but there should be enough to get you going! Have fun!
		
Easter is always coming, and in 2018 it's April Fool's Day!

I'll say little more about what this code does (it is not nefarious) but if you want an egg for your site you'll have to hunt around the code to see exactly what you'll get.

This should be as much fun for the site owner to descramble and customize as it is for those who visit a site and come across it.

Though there is a default action that links to one of my own creations feel free to make it fun and link to your own diversion. Just use the yolk() function to scramble up your own URL to redirect to.
